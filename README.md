# Code Project: Day One 

**Project:** Kingston University London – Learning Management Login Screen

**Description:** At University, we are currently working on a project that is focused on re-designing and improving our current learning management system. We have three releases to come a prototype, alpha and beta. Along with a peer, I set myself the task of creating an initial draft of a login page for the learning management system that students can use to access their module and course content.

**Languages Used: ** HTML, CSS

**Github Repository:** https://github.com/JessWallace94/dayOneCode

**Process:** Throughout the day I have been watching Youtube videos from DevTips. He created a pretty awesome video on Flexbox: https://youtu.be/G**7EIAgfkhmg. For the project, I started by looking at CodePen for some inspiration which led me to create the basic HTML markup for the project. For the CSS, I started by doing the initial CSS focusing on the html and body elements. Following that I focused specifically on the div login-card and the elements within that div such as the logo and the form(and it’s input). In order to achieve the equal split between the logo element and the form element, I used **_display: flex;_** with **_justify-content: space-around;_** and **_align-items: center;_** to get the content to sit in the right position. I’m very aware that this isn’t the cleanest way to achieve this, but I wanted to have a play around with some html and css using some flex.
